‘’Inequality of outcome among today’s generation is the source of the unfair advantage received by the next generation. If we are concerned about equality of opportunity tomorrow, we need to be concerned about inequality of outcome today.’’   
                             Anthony B. Atkinson

   The world financial model is inequality by design. Wealth is the total assets held with a market value.
From houses to lands, gemstones to company stocks, and to the money in a bank account, many real and financial assets can construct one’s wealth. 
The important factors that value wealth are the political power that accompanies it, the economic effect, opportunities it provides to the holder, and the attainable revenue.
Considering these factors, it is possible to say that what makes wealth important is also what makes wealth disequilibrium crucial: inequality in the political and social spheres of influence.
Additional to the outcomes of wealth disequilibrium and inequalities it creates at other spheres, its effects on State economies and over the dynamics of the global economy are essential.
To deeply understand the financial inequality of the modern world, one must first think about what these inequalities are.
At first sight, it may look like the gap between rich and poor, but going down in the hole, one sees the giant digging machine at the bottom.
The digging machine, while ensuring for only some to utilize the opportunities offered on a daily basis and for others and their names to never meet these opportunities in a sentence, the machine dugs deeper every passing day.
So powerful this machine derives its force from the trust of both sides and on their faith in the indestructible unity of the segregating machine.
We need to examine the machine’s anatomy.
The States compose the outer shell, and we see government, then big corporations respectively, as we go deeper into the machine.
This morally deficient machine of a perfect design to manipulate has only one purpose; to ensure that a person’s financial rights are only as much as their service to the machine.
This way, even when the world advocate equality, that equality can never be met in the financial world.
Every time a threat is posed to the machine, it instantly reacts.
Did a new opportunity come up that could harm the wealth disequilibrium balance?
The solution is simple, forbid it. Did forbidding not work? Let it, but limit it…
Fill the hole dug for many years, yet another one can occur. But this does not mean we should stop.


# The hope for giving the next generations the chance to live a good life lies in extensive development that makes possible for everyone what is only attainable for a few today, giving them a survival chance in a new, uncontaminated financial world; while preventing another hole from being dug.
